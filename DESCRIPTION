Description: A Reproducible Data Object (RDO) encapsulates both
    data and R code needed to reproduce those data. Each RDO can have
    other RDOs as dependencies. RDOs can be composed into complex tree
    hierarchies. Interacting with an RDO tree is similar to interacting
    with a single RDO. You can (re)run the code and refresh the cache,
    check status, validate if the code still gives the same cached data,
    clear data cache, access code and data cache of any of the
    dependencies. RDOs can be cloned and code of cloned dependencies can
    be modified.
