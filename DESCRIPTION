Description: Reproducible Data Objects (RDO) encapsulate both
    data and R code needed to reproduce the data.  The RDOs can be
    composed into complex tree hierarchies.  Interacting with such complex
    RDO is similar to interacting with a single RDO.  You can rerun the
    code and refresh the cache, check RDO's status, validate if the code
    still gives the cached data, clear data cache, or access code and data
    cache of any of the dependencies.  The RDOs can be cloned and code of
    dependencies can be modified.  The RDOs can be send to a user via
    Plumber API.
